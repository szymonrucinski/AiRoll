# AI movie editor
## Introduction
This is a python GUI program developed with Windows in mind which uses state of the art A.I CNN combined with signal processing to mimic a human video-editor in domain of short music videos cut to the beat of the music.

## Overview
Video editing also called montage is an artistic process of assembling pieces of video in an arbitrary order to tell a story and trigger emotional reponse in audience. Over last decades editing was only associated with tv and cinema. With fast development of technology and rise of the social medias people started recording, editing and sharing more videos than ever before. Due to popularization of smartphones and increasing number of people living in the rush the demand for dynamic and condensed content raised. Everyone wants to share fanstastic video content with minmal amount of editing. It is estimated that video content generates 80\% of the whole internet traffic

## Purpose
The aim of this project is to
 propose a solution to the problem of automated editing of short video forms and generating interesting footage by a user without any knowledge about video post-production. The current state and techniques applied to editing short videos provide evidence that editing compilations, trailers or music videos could be automated. This paper presents a system that uses image recognition, audio and image processing to mimic 3 basic skills of a video editor.
Differentiating types of shots, making cuts to the rythm of the music and determining wherevere the provided footage is stable or not. Such system could enable users to collect their favourite video-clips from a certain event, add music and generate a short movie that could be later published.

## Building
